Database Internals by Alex Petrov is a deep dive into the inner workings of modern databases, offering a detailed look at topics like storage engines, indexing, and query processing. The book covers a wide range of database types, from relational to NoSQL, and explains complex concepts like consensus algorithms, transaction management, and data replication. Petrov's clear explanations and practical examples make it approachable for engineers looking to understand databases at a system level, though some prior knowledge of data systems is helpful. It's an invaluable resource for anyone interested in database design, optimization, or low-level data architecture.
