Apache Kafka is an open-source event streaming platform that can transport huge volumes of data at very low latency.

Companies like LinkedIn, Uber, and Netflix use Kafka to process trillions of events and petabtyes of data each day.

Kafka was originally developed at LinkedIn, to help handle their real-time data feeds. It's now maintained by the Apache Software Foundation, and is widely adopted in industry (being used by 80% of Fortune 100 companies).
