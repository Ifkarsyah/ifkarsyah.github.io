## Introduction

Understanding user behavior is crucial for optimizing website performance and enhancing the user experience. 
One way to do that is by building a clickstream analytics system. But, what is Clickstream? 
Well, clickstream is a sequence of hyperlinks one or more website visitors follows on a given site, presented in the order viewed.
Clickstream analysis is useful for web activity analysis, software testing, market research, and many other usecases.

This article demonstrates how to build a real-time clickstream analytics platform using Apache Flink for stream processing and ClickHouse for fast querying and analysis.

Tools:
- **DataGen**: Generates sample clickstream data for testing.
- **Apache Kafka**: Collects and streams clickstream data from DataGen.
- **Apache Flink**: Processes and transforms data from Kafka topics before sending it to ClickHouse.
- **ClickHouse**: Stores and queries the processed data efficiently.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes data through interactive dashboards.

## Architecture

## Implementation

### Data Ingestion

Generate sample clisktream with datagen
Configure Flink to consume data from Kafka topics.

### Data Transformation

Implement Flink jobs to enrich and transform clickstream data.
Perform real-time aggregations to derive metrics like page views, user sessions, and more.

### Data Visualization

Build dashboard with Grafana.

## Demo

Check out the demo in the YouTube video to see the platform in action.
